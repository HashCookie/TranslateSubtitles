00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,490
SPEAKER 1: Welcome, everyone.

1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,350
My name is Carter.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,683
And today I'm going to show you my guessing game and how

3
00:00:04,683 --> 00:00:07,310
I can use debug50 to help figure out what's wrong with it.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,520
So here, I'm trying to write a guessing game that

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,960
is written in the spirit of the elementary school game

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,377
where you would guess a number and someone would tell you,

7
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:14,211
it's right or wrong.

8
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:15,940
And I called my program Guess.

9
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,240
So I can run it in the terminal with ./guess.

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,570
Here go to ./guess, hit Enter, and I have to guess a number.

11
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,630
So here I might guess, maybe 2, and hit Enter.

12
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,880
But then I get this flood of messages in the terminal.

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,205
And I'm wondering, well, what's wrong with this?

14
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:32,830
Why am I getting so many messages here?

15
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:39,070
And to try to figure that out, I can go into my code with code guest.c.

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,000
And then I can see, well, I'm not entirely sure what may be wrong here.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,070
So I need to pause my code at some point.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,800
And for that, I can use a break point.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,100
So let me go ahead and go to this left side of my guess.c file, where

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,040
I see these red circles pop up.

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,640
I can click on one of them to turn it bright red.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,760
And at that point, I've set a pause point in my code.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,269
And I can use debug50 to go in and actually step through my code

24
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,680
and see what's going on in there.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,500
So let me go ahead and type debug50 of guess, hit Enter.

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,140
So now that I have my code opened up in debug50,

27
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,550
I can see a few different things.

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,150
I can see that my number variable is currently set to 0.

29
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,550
And my guess is currently set to this odd 32,764.

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,300
But as I go through my code, I'll actually

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,350
see those numbers fall into place.

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,510
So if I use this Step Over button to walked to the next line of my code,

33
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,240
I can see that number becomes 5, as I expect it to on line 6.

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,410
And then as I go to line 8 and Step Over that, I get prompted for,

35
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,610
what's my guess?

36
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,670
And at that point, I might type, well, 3 again.

37
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,940
And I'll hit Enter.

38
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,130
And then I see guess becomes 3.

39
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,680
So now I'm wondering, well, if my guess is wrong and my number is 5,

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,750
my guess is 3, shouldn't I only get wrong guess just once?

41
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,970
So I'll actually just keep walking through my code with Step Over.

42
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,700
And I'll see, I'm printing "Wrong guess!", which seems right.

43
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,650
And now I should just exit the program.

44
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,430
That should be it.

45
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,580
But I really see that my line in that yellow highlight

46
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,236
is going back up to 10, line 10 there.

47
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:18,650
And it's actually continuing to go through and print "Wrong guess!"

48
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,700
And so at this point, I can actually see that maybe the bug in my code

49
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,320
is I shouldn't have used a while loop.

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,330
I should have, maybe, used an if statement,

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,890
where I'm only checking for this condition once.

52
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,550
So now that my while loop has changed to an if statement,

53
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,530
I should be able to recompile my code and see what's changed.

54
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,800
So I can use "make guess".

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,760
And then I'll run my code, guess.

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,550
And when I guess 3, I guess I should get "Wrong guess!"

57
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,870
So I'll do 3.

58
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,310
And then I'll get "Wrong guess!", but also "You're correct!".

59
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,110
And at this point, there's probably another bug in my code.

60
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,380
And so I'll actually leave this one up to you,

61
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,220
to use debug50 and see, well, why am I getting both "Wrong Guess!"

62
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,520
and "You're correct!"?

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,000
